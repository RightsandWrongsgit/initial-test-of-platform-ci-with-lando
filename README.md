This respository provides a template to build a Drupal website with a CI/CD Workflow driven by standard Git commands.  The template should be considered a 'base' to which you would add modules, change themes, etc. to build any number of sites of your own.  The workflow uses Lando for a container based local environment which is then linked to Platform.sh hosted environments.  On the host you have a 'develop' environment directly linked to the local for continued but untested updates while you work.  There is a 'staged' environment which you refresh at points where you have made some level of satisfactory progress on something you are working upon and ultimately it becomes the point where you conduct any tests or share for client approval before release to production.  The production environment is called 'main' and is considered the point of truth; it is what is running for the world to see.

There is extensive detailed documentation on how this is put together and how you can clone the template to start your project.  The documentation also reviews modules you might find helpful for various things you want to include.  If you aren't real technical yet, the documentation also provides the basics on foundational knowledge to get you going.  Simply pull up HTTP://www.armtec.services in another tab in your browser and get going.

Enjoy!
